Our National Flag has bite Ashok Chakra on it. This wheel is symbol of
DHARMA. It we always do the right things, we follow DHARMA. The twenty four
spokes in the wheel show the differences between our-people. A small circle
connects these spokes. It shows that we are one. The wheel also shows that we
are going forward.
Our flag is a tri-colour. Saffron is the symbol of sacrifice and a strong mind.
White is the symbol of purity, love and peace. Green is the symbol of plenty and
joy. We hoist and salute our flag. We are ready to make sacrifices for our
country. We want peace and progress. We want to be pure.
Our 'National Anthem' is a song of the great poet Tagore. It was his prayer song.
He sings about the people, mountains, rivers and seas of India. He says that God
is the master of all these and everyone and everything in India praise him. We
sing this song in colours with respect.
All of us salute our National Flag and sing our National Anthem. This shows that
we are one nation. We also promise to love and respect our country, our parents,
elders, teachers and all others in India.
